# Application Tracker

This is a little side project I've been working on to familiarize myself with C# using Microsoft's .NET MVC framework.

The purpose of the web platform is to allow users to track applications they've sent or plan to send to employers.

## Functions
- Account registration, with information safely hashed using Microsoft's built-in Identity API.
- Password changing.
- Users can add, view, edit, and delete applications.
- Search functionality to find specific applications quicker

## To Do
This project is not yet fully complete. There is a little bit of work left before I'd consider the project complete:
- Modify password changing functionality to be more secure
- Connect project to SQL server rather than locally hosting the database
- Deploy project as an actual website
